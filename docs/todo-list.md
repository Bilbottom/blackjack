# To Do List

## Base Game

- Implement cards 'burns' to keep some info hidden from the players
- Find out whether dealer blackjack beats player blackjack
- Find out whether a dealer blackjack beats a player 21
- Find out whether a player blackjack beats a dealer 21
- Include insurance for when dealer starts with A
- Add side bets!

## Nice UX

- Implement the game in pygame (partially for fun, partially to confirm that everything works correctly)

## Automated Strategy

- Simulate n plays (in x games?) using the strategy matrices
- Research common top strategies to give multiple matrices
- For each matrix, compute an expected return to player

## Card Counting

- Implement card counting per game to determine strategy

## Cards In Play

- Use all cards in play to determine strategy
